Frontend Stack (WordPress VPS):

    React/Next.js (Optional, if Bricks needs more flexibility)
    WordPress (as the CMS for content and Bricks Builder for design)
    GraphQL (for efficient API communication between WordPress and Medusa)
    Nginx (as a web server)
    ImageMagick (for dynamic image processing)

Backend Stack (Medusa VPS):

    Node.js (primary runtime for Medusa)
    PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for dynamic data storage)
    Redis (for caching API responses)
    Nginx (for API handling)
    Docker (optional for containerization of services)

Cross-Functional Frameworks:

    API Integration: RESTful or GraphQL APIs to link the headless Medusa backend with the WordPress frontend.
    Caching: Redis for tiered caching of product variations, transients, and API responses.
    DevOps Tools: Docker (for portability and containerized deployment), CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring services like Prometheus for performance tracking.
